	  	<h3>Print sales</h3>
		<p>
			If you are interested in buying a physical print of my art I'm happy to say that I have an online <a href="/store">store</a>.<br><br>
			I print all my pieces myself and ships them from Mölndal to ensure that I have full control over the quality of my work. The prints are made using a high end printer, archival grade inks 
			and Hahnemühle fine-art papers.<br><br>

			Shipping is included and the prints are shipped using PostNord as soon as the print is ready. 
			At this time I do not provide framing services for online orders due to the cost and difficulties of shipping framed items. 
			<br><br>

			If you have any questions regarding prints or ordering please write to <span>gallery@rahmn.net</span> or DM on <a class="normal" href="https://www.instagram.com/lukasrahmn/" >Instagram</a>
